Theres national shock when police fired water cannon & stun grenades at protestors. Opposition leaders voiced alarm, predicting the end would be intra-Israeli violence or a coup. No sense of National shock when Palestinian are shot beaten made homeless denied basic human rights.

In Hyde Park in London yesterday trans protestors against a 'Let women speak' event had signs saying there were 83 trans deaths by suicide in 2023 and that TERFs were responsible for every suicide as it was a preventable death. And threatened violence, while police stood by

I fear that Kellie-Jay Jean being surrounded by protestors and unable to leave & having projectiles thrown at her is unfortunately going to reinforce her martyr complex and claim that women aren't allowed to speak. Drown her out with vical protest but violence is not ok.

The French Police are really beating the shit out of protestors. No way can that level of violence not produce violent responses from protestors.
Remember: police are facing in the direction of the physical threat: the Trans & Queer community protestors that are lashing out against biological women for daring to speak about women issues… The real violence & threats to the public, especially women & vulnerable children,…
It’s really messed up that your kid goes to school. Exactly where there are supposed to be. & this craziness happens. Man. Smh.#SchoolViolence
The prosecutors and courts want to stop protests. They want to criminalize protestors and people who prepare themselves for police violence and abuse, for violation of civil rights. They want to criminalize helping one another, sharing a phone number. They will not succeed.

It really makes me wonder. After weeks of trans rights activists calling for violence, including Jane Fonda, and specifically in TN due to legislation, and protestors specifically mentioning Christians. How was the school not on high alert? It's crazy.

The tactics used by the EFF are the same tactics they used in Sharpsville. Inciting violence under a peaceful protest banner, the cops start shooting when they were attacked, and the propaganda machine does the rest. Police shot peaceful protestors.

#notallrussians don't like when someone criticizes a political person for his actions. They just left russia and teach you what is right and what is wrong (the russians, whose country commits military aggression every decade) #RussiaIsATerroristState
Obviously, #Congress party thinks this kind of aggression on national TV is yielding political dividends for it. Good luck to them.  Certainly good for channel TRP.@sardesairajdeep  #SupriyaShrinate
ll the aggression on Twitter’s political space is because people don’t train. Sweet, palpable aggression wasted on something as empty as politics. Ugh
It's just sad seeing educated elites that should supposedly be learned and should know better, stirring up an agenda that creates division, distrust and passive aggression amongst the youths esp given the fragile state of our political climate. Bunch of sick people!
Yes. So can't be voting for such a collaborator of nihilist, Western political aggression

Absolutely barbaric.. WTF! #TNPolice & state’s political leadership should put an end to this unchecked & unnecessary aggression. Makes the brutality of ISIS pale in comparison.
Imagine saying with a straight face, to the whole world, that an unprovoked war of aggression is a political dispute. What a farce.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed – ahead of the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, which is set to take place next week – that Russia was ready for a political and diplomatic settlement of the war of aggression against Ukraine.
We are long overdue for a clampdown on Chinese state influence permeating government agencies, politicians, political groups and the press in the Philippines. As China ramps up its aggression and gray zone tactics against us, we must aggressively safeguard our security even more.
A political project to remove the left from the Labour party. If you're on the soft left thinking 'He's bad so it's ok' then you are next. Ed Miliband lost Scotland. Tony blair led a war of aggression that killed 100,000s. Please actually *think* about what is happening here.
Japan's aspiration to become a major political power is understandable, but this goal should not be achieved through military aggression, according to Global Times. #ChinesePerspectives

Despite the Putin’s arrest warrant, Ukraine considers that a special tribunal for the crime of aggression is still needed to prosecute him and other “highest political and military leadership” in absentia. The ICC Statute doesn’t allow trials in absentia.
Violence and the threat of is a tool used by the state used to keep power, instill fear and coerce citizenry. Violence can also a tool of the free people’s to fight against their oppressor’s, often the state, own violence and aggression towards said people. Both are political.
3/7 Meurant's house was bombed after his speech. The NZ state struck back in '90, when it arrested Maori activists at the beginning of the Commonwealth games, fearful that revolution might coincide with the opening ceremony at Mount Smart. Political aggression isn't new in NZ
#Nigerians Integrity matters! We have seen candidates & incumbents come out post-election to thank people for “electing them” in an election marred with political oppression, thuggery, ballot theft & aggression AND they stayed quiet!

They seceded due to Northen political and economic aggression which gave them no choice but to seek to form a new country. In fact, the Union had to mass conscript foriegn arrivals because some many White Northen men wanted nothing to do with the conflict.
Defence Minister @KhawajaMAsif spoke about the core political moments in Pakistan’s political history and the maturity shown by political parties in the past & the new culture of aggression being demonstrated today:
The fact is that culture wars are a strategic encroachment on certain people's civil rights. The GOP, as the leaders of this aggression, are using the execution of their culture wars for political purposes, wch makes that an act of domestic terrorism, not a symmetrical war.

How will India force Kashmiri Muslims to leave Kashmir? After crushing the political and armed resistance through brute repression, the next move is an assault on our economy. To achieve this, Indian state is targeting us through multiple fronts. 1. Since 2016, the ++

This points to the CPC being too far to the right to secure the votes of Canadians uncommitted to the Liberals. The Poilievre Party resistance to the Canadian political centre is the flame that burns the Conservative backside all day long.
The 1951 battle for supremacy inside the hallowed chambers at Ibadan reflected the push for the realisation of ZIK's dream for domination of political power & the ultimate resistance to subjugation by the yorubas. But, as detailed in his book ROAD TO NIGERIA'S INDEPENDENCE/
People condemn political violence like politics itself isn't rooted in violence. They just don't want any resistance to their system.
On 24 March 1944, the Nazi Sicherheitsdienst massacred 335 antifascists and Jews at Rome's Fosse Ardeatine. Giorgia Meloni has claimed they died just for being Italian. This is untrue: the atrocity was a political reprisal against the Resistance and drew on Italian-Fascist help
20 years later since America's brutal invasion of Iraq, it's interesting to go through the material that the Iraqi resistance (across political & religious differences) published throughout the years. There are appeals to Coalition forces in many of their videos.
Ahmad Shah Massoud (1953-2001) was an Afghan political and military leader who played a key role in the resistance against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and the subsequent civil war in the 1990s. He was born in the Panjshir Valley of Afghanistan and became a…

I think when you think about the future of the dollar as reserve currency better to think about what the US is doing than what China is doing . Treasuries market volatile and illiquid . Political resistance to deindustrialization . Geopolitical capital controls
For me feminism isn’t a political theory but a political practice. Feminism is the political resistance of women to the state. As soon as feminism is funded by the state it is corrupted. Feminism is the solidarity of all classes of women for a better future for our daughters. 1/
For those of you that are desiring specifics: It has been the neoconservative political class that gradualistically moved the Overton Window to where we are now while providing nothing more than staged, vocal resistance. They are the Old Hegelians: somewhat more conservative in…

People need to start looking around — in a hurry — for a party with the resolve & the moral muscle to lead the political resistance to Islamisation. There is only one. Join Britain First. The election will be upon us next year at the latest.
why does black cultural production need to be classed as a form of resistance or political to be seen as legitimate? especially when it isn't striving to be those things?
The police went to Zaman Park to comply with a court order , and the kind of resistance they met there deepened the suspicions that there is no house or office of a leader of a political party , but a terrorist organization has established a no- go area here
The history of crisis teaches that unless there's an organized political resistance, ready to seize power during the chaos, the ruling class will always work amongst themselves to find a new articulation of class power and restore accumulation.
Love it when people are saying we should be more like France and protest more…have y’all been paying attention to what’s been happening in Atlanta at all? The cop city resistance movement Is (imo) easily the most important political movement in the US rn
March, 24th, 1944. Ardeatine massacre, mass killing of 335 innocent civilians and political prisoners, was carried out in Rome by Nazis as a reprisal for attack by Italian Partisan Resistance in Rome against the SS Police the previous day. Fascism didn’t and will not prevail.
However, for sure, the constant feeling of insecurity among Zionists (linked to political turmoil), is due to the steadfast weapons & ever watching eyes of the Resistance in North (Hezbollah) & Gaza.

South Africa's political parties are simply too incompetent to mount a resistance to the ANC it's insane
Falling life expectancy delays raising of pension age to 68. Fear of political resistance also a factor.
I feel like I can't even use words like 'resistance' or 'deplorable' in my book because people will view them with a modern political lens and think the words sound dumb.
My thoughts on the Israeli political situation. Firstly, it's extraordinary to see civil resistance force Netanyahu to pause his illiberal judicial reforms, especially with a comfortable govt majority. The Israeli public have proven themselves an effective check on power. 
Ukraine has become a symbol of successful resistance against Russians and a true Georgian dream, but which is at the same time aligned with their political opponents. This is a deadly combination for Georgian Dream. 11/11
Let's be patient with the reconfiguration going on in the Nigerian political space. Naturally, there must be resistance here and there until we get there.
When are we going to give IK credit for introducing use of Hindi cinema songs as songs of political resistance in #Pakistan? This is no small achievement. And this further proves there is a Hindustani cinema number for everything in life. #Pakistan #India #TeriMitti
Dennis King just praised the Maple app. He supports private Healthcare. 
For the #Kurds, besides its cultural background, #Newroz is a symbol of resistance and struggle for freedom against tyranny. It is very much a political festival. It is a festival of the renewal of the oath of resistance. 
The youths have conquered the political machinery of Nigeria. The resistance we're seeing is nothing but the splashing of a sinking ship.
Interview highlights of Iraqi Resistance leader Sheikh Qais al-Khazali : • Unfortunately, the situation has reached a crossroads with the Sadrist movement from the political point of view. • There are positive and hopeful signs and messages from the new government.

The censorship through algorithmic siloing, oversaturation, and uninformative, time-wasting, distraction content is getting worse and worse. Whether it's censorship of economic,political,community, or Covid information, it's working to prevent any cohesive resistance movements.
Yes, Putin fears democracy; he invaded in 2014 after losing political grip over Kyiv and feared protests would spread to Russia. But for centuries, Ukraine has also been THE heart of the resistance against Moscow’s evils. Ukrainians even rose up as Stalin was starving them.
There should be an all over the country resistance against police and state brutality, enforced abductions and disappearances of political workers me. Women alike including children and give them a befitting response #PakistanUnderFascism #EnoughIsEnough
You know the PEI Green Party is getting desperate when their followers retweet content like this. The sweet smell of defeat is in the air. #peipoli #pei
One of the agents said, Hezbollah always maintains surprises. The names are not confirmed before Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Resistance, announces them himself.
western political resistance cannot always be applied transnationally and fails to ignore the work that has already been done in other countries. we are not inherently more capable and this mentality operates from a savior complex
Afghan resistance causing political unrest in Canada
Don't expect academics to subject extremely well-paid civil servants and political agendas to any awkward scrutiny. This is how we know climate change is bullshit, even if it's real
The BNR Rada has today awarded the Medal of the Pahonia Order to 11 #Belarus'an political prisoners and, posthumously,to 5 armed resistance fighters. We demand immediate release of all >1500 political prisoners held captive by the pro-#Russia'n regime in Belarus 
These years of resistance have resulted in thousands of political prisoners being tortured and, of course, executed. #No2ShahNo2Mullahs #No2ShahNo2Mullahs
The resistance movements assessed the political and field developments in #Palestine, most notably the Resistance in the occupied #WestBank and #AlQuds, and the mounting internal political crisis within the Israeli occupation.
It fights a class war on behalf of the predatory and propertied to protect their own interests, to expand those interests, and to crush political resistance of every kind to those interests. /3
This quote from Louise Casey shows the resistance to the idea that the serial abuses of the Met should be seen as a political failure. Citing her background is also revealing. Her work on troubled families a decade ago was notorious for ignoring the politics of austerity.
The only possible way to heal the deep divides with the libertarian movement and build the Party into a viable vehicle for political and social change is to get folks from various Libertarian factions together for a weekend of MDMA and talking the shit out. I'll facilitate
There is a hope. A light. With the increase in struggle of the Kurdish people behind their leader, political representatives and party this year could be the year of VICTORY. This Newroz could fan the flames of Kurdish resistance all the way to VICTORY! 
If you want to be in the political theater, you must play your part, speak your lines, and know that eventually your curtain will fall. I personally hope that the stage collapses
Anytime a political leader is arrested for trivial, fabricated, victimless, or non-, crimes, I want to be outraged at the continued lack of justice, but I'll leave that to the people that give a shit
While everyone plays political theater, I burst onto set screaming, MACBETH

If you throw 1 stone, it's a punishable offense. If 1,000 stones are thrown, it's political action. Protest is when I say I don't agree with something. Resistance is when I ensure that things which I disagree no longer take place. – Ulrike Meinhof, Baader-Meinhof Complex (2008)
Absolute horseshit on the @BBCWorld  Global News podcast with Hugh Schofield depicting protests as a cultural resistance of the French to political reforms & change. Do your homework & look at the waves of reforms over the past decade. People protest against *inequalities*.
their war to reverse the advances in social justice of the last 70 years does not make an exception for the young. if we do, our resistance cannot win. violence against the young in all its forms is a political issue. it is a structural issue. it is a social justice issue.
You work for the American people — not the other way around. Do it! Quit playing political games for you pathetic self. You’re one sad pathetic individual. Get help.
One last plug for this conversation. There's really a lot to learn and sit with discussed here, about sovereignty, about language and worldview, and about autonomous political struggle in resistance to genocide via assimilation, extermination, and dispossession.
In his family home in the South, he would gather with other Resistance fighters in a small wooden room in their yard to plan their operations.
This is just the beginning. We have an entire presidential election that is going to use Black excellence and Black resistance to fuel white resentment for political power. Educational White Rage!!! #punishedfordreaming is coming soon.
Resistance as a culture represents the combined spirit of individuals and communities who actively challenge and stand up against the dominant cultural, social, political, or economic systems that try to keep them down or push them to the fringes. This form of resistance 1/3
When an ex army chief & ex generals speak, or supposedly speak with media and talk only of politics, politicians & political manipulations and not about security or militancy it is time to worry. Alarm bells about national security must begin to ring.

There is no religion called hindutva. It’s only a political term and often used as militancy against other religions to gain power in a Hindu majority but secular country.

Sustained rioting, without sustained political organisation, does not equal an advance for the Left. No, we shouldn't 'be like the French'. Next election there will yield another hard Right government or a Fascist one. France has deep problems that cartoon 'militancy' obscures.
While handing over power to 1st political govt after 7-yr-long militancy & President's rule in 1996, J&K Guv Krishna Rao told me in an interview: We have defeated Pakistan. It's no longer a challenge. I fear some politicians in our system can sustain & revive it again & again.

With soaring inflation, lurking militancy,  and the ongoing political discord, the plight of laymen is succinctly summed up in this song.#Pakistan There Is Mean Things Happening In This Land https://youtu.be/ZxRJoHDgiVo via @YouTube
Ultimately you need a program with clear demands around the state and political unity within a party (or parties, at least) to harness militancy, which requires the internal and theoretical work people disparage in favor of action for its own sake.
The world does not identify IPOB as terrorists. It is nigeria corrupt government that is tagging IPOB as terrorists. It's all political to suppress the easterners. Militancy had it own share of killings n assets destruction in SS but was addressed by Late Yaradua.
It occurs to me that you can apply the principles behind the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to Social & Political Movements; people forgot it's not a sudden onset of revolutionary militancy that drives epochal changes but the gradual disbalance between it & the forces of…

this isn't all bad- more leftists in the world is good, I am here to recruit from both ends- but. it does mean we have a lot of trans people who jump feet first into militancy and are suddenly having a lot of political 'clicks' that push them there but not a lot of experience
Politicians push militancy and direct action for political change and mean’s and are somehow surprised when people on the edges take it to an extreme.
Why do your god wants you to do the militancy? Isn’t he powerful enough to defend or go on offensive for you guys? Or maybe he doesn’t really exist or ur religion is a political ideology in religious disguise, which one?
It's Niger Delta militancy, the beginnings of the Boko Haram group, repeating themselves all over again. Non-state actors backed and patronised by prominent politicians for electoral and political gains and purposes, until they grow too big to be tamed by ordinary measures.
One of the major implications of what the Lagos APC did in the build-up to the gubernatorial election is that the thugs they empowered in Lagos are about to become bolder. Guess who will not be able to control them. 
It is all under a political agenda that this has carried on. Punjab has already suffered a lot. Where did you hear of militancy in Punjab in last 30 years before this instance. No one voiced Khalistan. We are happy in Punjab.
Successive civilian and military governments have failed to end socio-economic disparities, disharmony between the centre and provinces, poverty, apathy towards the less-privileged, militancy, religious and political intolerance—just to mention a few.
I love this passage but the sword is in reference to the spiritual & political division he would bring. Not any militancy.
I can't kill any Hindu in the name of Sikhism .i.e. my consciousness. There should be only political soln rather than militancy against the state. Sikhism is religion of peace not violence. If u want to preach or follow Sikhism, u can follow it anywhere, no special state needed
1984 was nothing but a political revenge of congress against Sikhs. And Hindus were the primary victims of militancy not Sikhs. For mass arrests,it was inevitable because when one particular community does separatism, govt is forced to arrest many people including innocents
Thr r no buyers of fake victimhood of Khalistanis. Sikhs dominate political & social order in Punjab wch also hv Hindus who hv lost everything in militancy, yt Hindus don't cry victimhood. Thr r no UN designated Hindu terror org, bt thr r several UN designated Sikh terror org.
SGPC is equivalent of Kashmiri Separatist- Hurriyat Conference, promoting Khalistani agenda and militancy in the garb of political religious organization. The only difference is - there they encourage Muslim youth in throwing stones, here Sikhs are using Swords to terrorize
For one, while many New Left radicals have published memoirs, this is a rare account from the adult child of a 1960s-era US guerilla-style leftist militant. It illustrates generational trauma resulting from high-risk political militancy and state violence...

If anything, EFF #NationalShutdown has proven that: We have no policing & resource problems. We have political will & selective morality problems. We have no electricity generational capacity issues. We have political will, internal sabotage & privatisation-drive issues. #Malema
This is exactly what’s needed- when we are denied our political voice through sabotage and subterfuge we have to use, as the great Malcolm X would say,“whatever means necessary “ we defend ourselves with the unions against these unjust laws.
My view on Labour: A group of people felt a political party belonged to them and they engaged in sabotage to sieze control from ordinary people. They used mendacious and nefarious means to do it and anyone who doesn't see this is ignorant or themselves mendacious.
We urge you to conduct an investigation to find out who the sabotage(s) is/are and what is happening on your platform that has led to the silencing and erasure of hundreds of accounts who post political content in favor or against particular groups and individuals./..

A group of over 100 civil society organisations, bar councils, trade unions, journalists, human rights bodies have launched an urgent appeal for political dialogue on the holding of elections: he leadership of the major political parties is on a war path and leaves little room
for dialogue and accommodation. Therefore, with all sincerity and a non-partisan approach, we call upon all political parties, the parliamentary parties in particular, to bring down current confrontational and intolerant rhetoric and sit together to sort out their political
differences on the holding of election in the greater interests of the nation, the supremacy of the constitution and a mutually agreed peaceful democratic transition...We appeal to all parliamentary parties to hold an all-parties conference or/and sit together in the Parliament
The back story is even more ironic. A rightwing sheriff can concoct an indictment against a Dem official and sabotage his political career. On the other hand, a Republican can *evade* indictment by pursuing a political career. “Orwell and Kafka walk into a bar…”
How many are convinced that despite all the legal eagles that Congress has at its disposal & Beck & call no one advised Rahul Gandhi of the consequences of being convicted in a criminal defamation case. Was this a deliberate attempt to sabotage his political career.

Labour have confirmed what we knew all along. A small group of people felt a political party belonged to them and they engaged in sabotage to sieze control from ordinary people. They never cared about racism or they'd have been all over this.
That being said, be wary of people who are trying to start political arguments inside #NAFO. This is an age-old opposition tactic to sabotage & splinter successful movements. When the Ukraine war ends, we can argue about other political issues. Until then, we are a united front.

The GOP will consort with the enemies of their own country in order to sabotage their political opponents. They cannot win on merit alone because they have none.
Here's the difference between the Tories and Labour. Labour will vote thru Sunak's Windsor Framework because it represents progress. If the tables were reversed, the Tories would vote down any such Labour legislation for the sake of political sabotage.

Better you take half of the blame for yourself because one of many reasons why some of stupid dictators are rejecting US food relief is due to the political sabotage and instability like you did to Ethiopia specifically to people of Tigray Genocide
Political diversion will sabotage the cause because it's politics and politicians know how to make fool of the people by giving false hopes. It's my sincere recommendation to keep politics and politicians away from the stance.
There's no need for high grocery/gas prices. It's corporations that are causing inflation. Political sabotage. It's trump appointed Jerome Powell & his off the chain interest rates which aren't even affecting corp inflation, but is destroying banks. #RepublicansAreTheProblem
It looks like the political musician #rarara house and office has been looted in Kano, the good political maturity displayed by the good people of Kano is being sabotage by opportunist vandals... Respect & freewill
The Global Times is pushing the “Australian threat” theory in this editorial on Oz-China relations after AUKUS. Also says Japan is trying to sabotage Australia’s relations with China. Urges “political wisdom” from the Albanese government https://globaltimes.cn/page/202303/1287858.shtml
It’s healthy to let us sabotage your existence in ignorance. Close the blinds, baby. Have a drink. Watch some reality tv, but not the political kind.
For 42 years, this guy, Ben Barnes, sat on the secret sabotaging of Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign. The entire US political system is corrupted. Revealed: The alleged secret plot to sabotage Jimmy Carter's reelection by delaying hostage release
Republicans sabotage Democrats so operatives can blame Democrats for failing. “Obama’s early years in office were marred by a scorched-earth political campaign Republicans wielded to try to thwart what became the Affordable Care Act.”
And if they really wanted the border fixed, they would not have put forth a plan that gets rid of 2,000 border agents. It's sounds like they are trying to make things worse. Political sabotage. #USA #America #American SANE #Republicans #Republican #seniors #women #Veterans 
If it's anti-Military then I posit many tenured professors could not care less about the optics as it fits their personal political weltanschauung. The school, disingenuously caring, I say y'all are 100% there. Complainers may face sabotage from faculty when it comes to grades.
Britain has reached where the US has been for quite some time—a cabal of political elites hijacking the country, operating its own agenda, regardless of which political party is formally in power—and the people at large having lost control of their govt.
Conspiring with a hostile foreign government to keep American citizen in captivity and to sabotage a rival's political campaign. Republicans have always been traitors to America. Ben Barnes should be in prison.
Perhaps they support Capital as Power with Strategic Sabotage both economic and political?
Elephant (no pun intended) in the room: We have a 2-party political system in which members of one party sabotage their own party and assist the opposing party. Thoughts?
There have been some things that make it possible to say something is changing at the political level .. Who hates today will love tomorrow . .There was a sabotage at #Nordstream2
trump appointed Jerome Powell needs to be fired. He's constantly raising interest rates to tame inflation & it isn't doing anything but effing up banks & crashing the stock market. The inflation problem is being caused by corporations and IMHO...it's political sabotage.
It's all part of the  we know damn well we ain't got enough legitimate signers so let's cry sabotage to deflect plan. Election denial is very popular in a certain political party now. Can't win? Then just LIE about everything #lalege #lagov
It's his turn to eat, of course he's gonna say corruption is not the cause of loadshedding. We have people we know who work daily for Eskom who tell us their jobs are being made difficult due to political interference and sabotage so they can benefit from sudden breakdowns
Send to @JohnKasich who follows me (thank you). A competent Republican president will need years of dedicated effort to repair the damage to our nation. It will take even longer if there is political sabotage by Democrats or RINOs that are hidden inside cabinet agencies.
Be careful of the political sabotage, now I see what you mean by being objective uncle. I feel that they exploit the urge to go to war based on sensory type input. Like showing you something to make you mad and then going to war based on that instead of Truth.
Dear @hrw @UNHumanRights and @Declaracion kindly note that police with the direction of @OfficialDGISPR is arresting @PTIofficial political workers to sabotage the democratic process in Pakistan. We ask immoderate attention from @UN to ensure to basic human rights in Pakistan

More shades of Republican anti-American political corruption, reminiscent of Richard Nixon and Vietnam: The alleged secret plot to sabotage Jimmy Carter's reelection and elect Ronald Reagan by delaying Iran hostage release.
Actually he is a victim of hate crime, of political sabotage, and the jmafia
I don’t want to have this conversation until people can understand POLITICAL SABOTAGE!!
We might dunk on Modi as much as we like, but no change will happen until we reform BJP and RSS. And the only way to do that is internal sabotage. Starting your own political organization isn't worth the effort because it will take you 2-3 decades just to build a decent followin
my advocate political will..is at play I think some of the politicians because of factions sabotage each other,
The internal party sabotage of Corbyn was only part of the picture; the wider establishment went into anti-democratic overdrive to destroy him and made no attempt to hide it. UK political journalism was a disgrace 2015-2019, and remains so.
You have not achieved this in your political existence with government resources you have, the EFF achieved this despite the sabotage and intimidation by heavy security forces, instructing buses not to transport people, the EFF made history
In just gonna create my political group and press forward with my own objective and ignore everyone bullshit who wants to join the men of no nation. We just work together to stop bad shit from happening world wide. Like prevention of nuclear war by self sabotage.
While AI will certainly help with city planning, most of the hurdles to urban sustainability are political, not technical, and I don't think AI will fix our tendencies towards political self-sabotage.
'Bragg' Political Party Sabotage Findings In Any Manner, Whistle Blowers, Online, Emails, Documents, Deception, Bias, Cover-Ups, Can Cause Hazardous 'Hatch Act' Violations That Will Start The End Of His Career.
Political sabotage and holding hostages longer than needed all in the hopes to win an election? It sounds like a Grisham novel but it is in fact a part of modern American history. We talked with  @hwbrands  this afternoon to get all the details
This, in my opinion, continues to be one of the greatest acts of political sabotage-humiliation of all times.
Standing up to political sabotage is a good beginning. Almost every cop yelled out #CutsHaveConsequences but were shouted down. Top Brass need to look after their troops not take advantage of their loyalty. The Public are watching you.
Political sabotage of Trump presidency has been also orchestrated by British Intelligence (Read British Crown)
Besides, the statute of limitations for this type of charge is 5 years and the incident happened over 6 years ago. This is just another frivolous attempt to sabotage a political opponent in the next presidential election. This just gos to show how scared the other side is.
Case and point! This planned sabotage by government every time just for political voting strategy is bullshit.
Banditry is political and the roots are so deep.most local politicians and security agents are involved and sabotage and blackmail is the order of the day..it is a booming business far from being wiped out
The evidence that....this is a man-made crisis....and a subterfuge sabotage of Political Factionalism.... We need to remove this toxic mafia groups(MyANC factions), masquerading as politicians
So with all the political giants in @OfficialPDPNig , no one can subtly sabotage Wike? No enemy of my enemy is friend strategy? Weaklings. All huff and puff with no depth.
#Lahore city & various other cities across the province of #Punjab in #Pakistan are practically under siege, ostensibly 2 sabotage a political rally organized by #PTI. This is what #Fascism looks like. Ur slumber is dumbfounding @hrw @amnesty @RSF_inter @UNHumanRights @IFJGlobal
War comes in different forms, political sabotage is one one them
How to try to sabotage Perrottet’s political career.MORrisON can be a sneaky turd,..
I think he escaped with help from some political party. There’s no way he could have crossed those barricades without internal sabotage to help him evade arrest.
Decades of mismanagement of the British economy by greedy, corrupt self-serving, political parasites and their cronies has ruined our economy. Brexit hasn't had a chance to be a success due to constant sabotage and is unlikely to be a success this side if a financial 'crisis'.
Pretty insane that Gaetz, currently leading a political rebellion paralyzing the United States House of Representatives, just two years ago was asking the White House to preemptively pardon him for sex trafficking.
If British Army had tried evict 7 to 10,000 in one go it'd have sparked a rebellion. Our own rich and their political servants are as bad as the old Empire. Working class Ireland needs to rise and evict this cruel black & tan landlord government. 1pm April 1st Dail.
Raging With The Machine: It was once America’s outlet for political and cultural rebellion, but now rock and roll has taken a disturbing new direction, endorsing censorship, Covid mandates, and, worst of all, conformity.
I lived in North Carolina during the big 2016 anti-trans push. I cried the night HB2 passed at 2am, making it illegal for me to go to the bathroom. The chancellor of my university supported it too meaning I couldn't go pee without it being an act of political rebellion.
While I see our subcontinent Shias sharing lots of words, poetry & eulogies commemorating Imam Hussain's departure from Medina (28 Rajab), there's no mention that it was the start of an epic political rebellion & revolution against the Taghoot system.
“I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical…. It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.” —Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, January 30, 1787
. Mdara Mudzuri hana yavo hairovi. Just watched a presser signaling yet another MDC-T presser. Sadly, the split has no political significance whatsoever. The MDC as we knew it, long died. In fact, the Mudzuri led rebellion is pretty much a fight over a stinking carrion.
When Jesus cleared the temple, he wasn’t trying to start a violent political rebellion. He was simply highlighting the difference between love which gives gratefully and generously and greed which exploits and abuses. From The Great Debate by Sacredise: https://centre.sacredise.com/TGDInfo
Final Talks on NI post-Brexit deal are taking place today with a deal imminent but could a political rebellion be brewing! #brexit #northernirelandprotocol #northernireland #postbrexit #rishisunak #eu #europeanunion #news
Five African countries. Political prisoners and rebellion. Drones and lawyers. Village women and gangsters. Honest civil servants and 'tax collectors.' Social media, surveillance and hope for change. A new Transnational Investigation will lauch later this month. Watch this space.
Dodd is denying a split between the Westminster Wing of the DUP who have permanent jobs and the MLAs facing the end of their political careers when the DUP pull down Stormont. But dissent happens in private conversations, not in party meetings, until a rebellion is imminent
It is being reported that three men and one woman have been arrested in connection to this demonstration. I wonder how the the former or DeSantas would handle this act of rebellion? Anything goes these days apparently if you go by the political climate in Florida. #ProudBlue
Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such thoughtcrime is, in fact,the worst of all crimes
Merely wanting to exist and enjoy some calm leisure time is sadly an act of rebellion and a political statement in this hyper-capitalist society that demands constant “productivity” of the working class, for the purpose of corporate/capitalist greed which can *never* be satisfied
We all knew Somaliland fiefdom will come to a Painful HALT one day but never this QUICK They could've EARLIER laid a Good Political inclusivety, agitate for Social Justice, Equal Opportunities, Protection of Minorities, Fair Economy But IGNORED To Quell Such REBELLION Not Easy!
The statement of the Federal Interior Minister is an open rebellion against the constitution and law. He doesn't care about the constitution or any law to crush political opponents. World community should take note of aggravating Human Rights situation in Pak.
If Yorubas are political rascals what do you call Igbo people who invested 24years into PDP and reap nothing and want to get to power by rebellion. I know when the time comes both their belligerent children and foolish fathers will be taken care of.
Now it was the time for political rebellion. 3. Sir Mian Muhammad Shafi along with Nawab Waqar-ul-Mulk Kamboh co-founded All-India Muslim League in 1906 4. Sir Mian Abdul Rashid, first Chief Justice of Pakistan 5. Adiral Haji Muhammad Siddiq : FirstNavy Chief of Pakistan
I'm convinced that Extinction Rebellion is somehow connected to the ULEZ scam. None of those interviewed practiced what they sought to impose on others, the right class, age and political persuasion, authoritarian. Publicity for Globalist policy.
Today three former tory leaders joined a rebellion that peaked at 20 MPs and Boris is fighting for his political survival. Meanwhile Rishi and Theresa…
I LOVE PADME SM i wish star wars actually emphasized padme and leias impacts like ??? Nobody talks about how leia was trained w the force ??? she was a whole rebellion leader, political leader, and was trained in the force??? And padme too, she was so strong
“I must thank the colonists for continuously teaching us to aspire to true humanity by means of rebellion” - Victor Yeimo, West Papuan Activist and political prisoner. Say his name #freevictoryeimo #freewestpapua #papuamerdeka #fightracism #endracism
A great revolution is never the fault of the people, but of the government. Revolution is political, rebellion is spiritual; revolution needs a crowd, rebellion is individual. Whether a revolution succeeds or miscarries, men of great hearts will always be the victims
February 8, 1939. #OTD Nikolai Nikolaevich Kuzmin, an Old Bolshevik, political commissar, most notably of the Baltic Fleet during the suppression of the rebellion at Kronstadt, and Order of the Red Banner recipient, was executed. He was rehabilitated in 1956.
Innocence was gone from all our acts. Our habitual state of rebellion became a serious political crime
> anti-social teenage rebellion against a free vaccine to protect the vulnerable in society > racism, homophobia & transphobia aren't 'political opinions' > point me to where any of your poorly attended protests were stopped > death threats, stalking should be taken seriously
Paris has been in uproar over pensions rebellion. The French political class asks “will the street win again?” I’m beginning to get that 1968 feeling! “Descendre dans la rue!”
Hard not to admire the French - they accept zero political bullshit without an almighty stooshie ! - #timeforchange #rebellion #nomore
I have seen so many people enjoying One Piece for the first time across platforms and it makes my heart so happy. Next, it will be Gundam. I'll make it so! Space drama, gorgeous battles, political commentary, survival, rebellion, and love! Y'all are ready. I know it.
#Pakistan don't have red line . Terrorists blowing up our mosques . #India carried out airstrikes inside #KPK in #Balakot. Political parties openly doing rebellion. Welcome to Banana Republic 
A lot of the time people forget that enslaved people in the British West Indies were very political. They often initiated rebellions in order to send a message to Parliament and the wider public. The Demerara Rebellion of 1823 is a good example of this.
Where are the European chads who just leave lol all I see are the European dweebs who pretend being a bad tipper is an act of political rebellion
“Mainstream media and the political class shrugged off the 2020 rebellion, and multinational corporations tried to co-opt it, but the conditions that propelled millions into the streets are still with us. People still yearn for a radical new future.”
The statement of the Federal Interior Minister is an open rebellion against the constitution and law. He doesn't care about the constitution or any law to crush political opponents. World community should take note of aggravating Human Rights situation in Pak.
