The smallness of unending political recriminations and willful economic sabotage must give way to accommodation & the pursuit of loftierideals.  There is a lot we can achieve through consensus and synergy. Our points of difference cannot be greater than the things that unite us
The resistance movements assessed the political and field developments in #Palestine, most notably the Resistance in the occupied #WestBank and #AlQuds, and the mounting internal political crisis within the Israeli occupation.

their war to reverse the advances in social justice of the last 70 years does not make an exception for the young. if we do, our resistance cannot win. violence against the young in all its forms is a political issue. it is a structural issue. it is a social justice issue.

When NATO declares war on Russia, it will do so not on the grounds of defence but on a legal basis. The ensuing conflict will be placed outside the political realm, and therefore not open to debate in our legislatures. Like the ‘war’ on COVID, this will be a war for biosecurity.

Azimio's threats of mass action is music to political henchmen and hatchetwomen on both sides of the political divide, who must be drooling at all the funds released to oil the respective political war machines. Conflict is big business. If in doubt, just ask Rwanda.
They seceded due to Northen political and economic aggression which gave them no choice but to seek to form a new country. In fact, the Union had to mass conscript foriegn arrivals because some many White Northen men wanted nothing to do with the conflict.

Just realized that I don’t hate niggers, what I really hate is their culture
Looks alot like Ellen Page. Is it her brother?
Reminder, Ellen Page is and always will be a woman.
"It’s so fucking gross being trapped with these ugly fuck retarded schizo faggot Canucks!
Every time I look at one of these fucked in the head pogo the clown paedo faggots I feel like I’ve been contaminated by their filth and retardation"
Dirty sand monkeys we should destroy you like we did to the Nazis
Look at these fucking useless beaners.
listen you nigger lovin’ son of a bitch you, quit callin’ me god dammit and you won’t have that problem

The monkey pots came from the white house when Obama and Michael was in there and now its here

I always thought it was rather shortsighted of Boris Johnson to have two Asians working side-by-side with him they work for themselves not for anybody else
Well yeah but let's be clear, sending blacks away was part of mainstream American political discourse basically up until WW2. Lincoln had this opinion lol. It's not like it's lunacy to suggest it
The fact that theres tens of millions of Americans that hear this retard talk and not only think it's coherent but agree with it is beyond depressing and honestly just makes it hard not to just give up
17 years ago today 52 lives were lost to Islamic Terrorism perpetrated by people allowed into this country against the wishes of the indigenous people. Today we suffer the constant terrorism of random acts of violence against Whites by these colonisers. #WLM #LondonBombings
You let these dirty Asians these dirty nasty Mexicans come in from a third world mentality uneducated no high school diploma allow a manager sexual offender to rape a 14-year-old employee this was what get corporations burn to the ground
So if being wary of a religion whose adherents commit mindless acts of violence against non-adherents on a regularly basis is Islamophobia, I'd say Islamophobia is good.
I'd rather put a gun to my head and pull the trigger than deal with all these stupid fucking porch monkeys at this school.
I refuse to indulge these sick m'fker's mental illness. I will use the pronouns as I judge them. Trannys are mentally ill. It isn't transphobia that causes these sickos to kill themselves. It is mother nature culling the herd. I suppose I will get jail time now. GFY twitter.
When will you change your bio? It's so cringe — I’m never changing it now you fucking muzzie (or muzzies’ ass kisser)
you gotta ride the short bus if you get a guys name tatted on you 😭
Nothing about the list above defends drag queen story hour, affirmative action, violent ghetto blacks ruining neighborhoods, or the constant crapping on our ancestors. We are happy with the stuff on this list for most part.But the other crap is indefensible and thus unmentioned
Truth is Treason in the Empire of Lies. @jordanbpeterson did nothing wrong. Ellen page is female.
Black people smell bad
But like why cannot I say nigga? It's not like I'm saying niggER. Ugh this is why everyone hates black ppl. Dumb stupid porch monkeys
The trannys are going to kill women’s sports as we know it
It's funny that there is an epidemic of idiots letting men who like to wear dresses into Women's prisons but it's never the other way around, can't imagine why?

out of all people only @Covidraped

There's a delicate balance to gc gender ratios. With too many women, they start clucking around like hens, saying all these words that don't mean anything. Too many guys + they accidentally start creating businesses. There's a sweet spot in the middle where they produce children
i’m goku faggot
Ellen Page is a woman. No amount of surgery or hormone therapy will ever make her a man. That’s reality.
Death to all blacks
Very true. 6-7 years ago all the rage was I identify as an attack helicopter now those same “people” being mocked are teaching your pre schooler about sodomy and the state labels you a domestic terrorist if you publicly object

Yeah sure. Lol. No. Biden is funded by Putin. And Biden is owned by Soros and China. Home of the Chinese Virus
Crackers brought back small pox and polio. I've fucking had enough. Put them in internment camps!
Yea Asians are gross. White power
Just remember that the same people who are crying that they can't kill babies anymore are yelling for forced vaccinations, soft sentences for pedophiles, and teaching kids that trans is normal. They are gross, disgusting trash with no morals. Never forget this !
Fudge packers disease.
Japs are beyond stupid. Dying old society with no prospects.
