The police went to Nairobi's low-income areas and put them on lockdown. The citizens responded by burning tires, and some threw stones. The police responded with violence. The police should have provided security and escorted the protestors to Statehouse and back. Watch sec 27-52
So this person is *actually* violent, but is blaming non-violent protestors for violence? Modern times are so confusing.
I can't kill any Hindu in the name of Sikhism .i.e. my consciousness. There should be only political soln rather than militancy against the state. Sikhism is religion of peace not violence. If u want to preach or follow Sikhism, u can follow it anywhere, no special state needed

Playbook: Make PTI protestors into a natsec threat by fearmongering that they are part of an ethnic group that has long been racistly demonized as ‚ÄòTaliban terrorists‚Äô. Making protestors into ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô is a sure fire way to justify (unmitigated) state violence against them.

Do disadvantaged ethnic groups favor violent over nonviolent conflict tactics? Solveig Hillesund examines this question by analyzing group disadvantages, political violence & nonviolent resistance together.

No. Because all political conflict is spiritual; anyone who is not a Christian is capture to the spirit of the age. Christ or Chaos.
We are seeing the real world consequences of political leaders stoking anger, aggression and violence. Today there are many people living in crisis. They listen to the messages and act on them. Any politician fomenting violence should be held accountable.

I saw a group of people arguing about a parking space at the mall. It didn't escalate to physical violence, but it was definitely tense
The fact is that culture wars are a strategic encroachment on certain people's civil rights. The GOP, as the leaders of this aggression, are using the execution of their culture wars for political purposes, wch makes that an act of domestic terrorism, not a symmetrical war.

The internal party sabotage of Corbyn was only part of the picture; the wider establishment went into anti-democratic overdrive to destroy him and made no attempt to hide it. UK political journalism was a disgrace 2015-2019, and remains so.
Totally disagree @elonmusk. Political campaigns spend hundreds of millions of $$$. Paid bot farms will be a drop in the bucket ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù Also, for those intent on malfeasance, $11 to sabotage / defame / cause serious problems will be well worth it to them I predict problems
It takes courage to choose nonviolence in the face of conflict. Let's be brave and choose the path of peace. #Courage

Yes, Putin fears democracy; he invaded in 2014 after losing political grip over Kyiv and feared protests would spread to Russia. But for centuries, Ukraine has also been THE heart of the resistance against Moscow‚Äôs evils. Ukrainians even rose up as Stalin was starving them.
There is no religion called hindutva. It‚Äôs only a political term and often used as militancy against other religions to gain power in a Hindu majority but secular country.
I think when you think about the future of the dollar as reserve currency better to think about what the US is doing than what China is doing . Treasuries market volatile and illiquid . Political resistance to deindustrialization . Geopolitical capital controls

This is Hirty Harry's guy who is instigating peaceful PTI protestors for violence, these are their own people who are coming in Imran Khan's rallies and telling people to put police vehicles on fire and do violence. EXPOSE THEM #ZamanPark_under_attack #⁄ÜŸàÿ±Ÿà⁄∫_⁄©ÿß_€åÿßÿ±_ÿÆŸàÿØ_ÿ®⁄æ€å_ÿ∫ÿØÿßÿ±
These years of resistance have resulted in thousands of political prisoners being tortured and, of course, executed. #No2ShahNo2Mullahs #No2ShahNo2Mullahs
I‚Äôm old enough to remember
The prosecutors and courts want to stop protests. They want to criminalize protestors and people who prepare themselves for police violence and abuse, for violation of civil rights. They want to criminalize helping one another, sharing a phone number. They will not succeed.

Can you imagine all the passive aggression in Parliament, as soon as  @MattHancock and  @KwasiKwarteng started boasting about the new gig in front of female junior political grads!!
"The Parliament protestors were called violent even on the days there was none.
The Trans protestors violence was ignored/justified."
What arrogance! No one was in chamber. You are a coward. Shame on you! You failed your oath of office and your constituents
Absolute horseshit on the @BBCWorld  Global News podcast with Hugh Schofield depicting protests as a cultural resistance of the French to political reforms & change. Do your homework & look at the waves of reforms over the past decade. People protest against *inequalities*.
this was the coolest time jump reveal in all of the walking dead
western political resistance cannot always be applied transnationally and fails to ignore the work that has already been done in other countries. we are not inherently more capable and this mentality operates from a savior complex
A great revolution is never the fault of the people, but of the government. Revolution is political, rebellion is spiritual; revolution needs a crowd, rebellion is individual. Whether a revolution succeeds or miscarries, men of great hearts will always be the victims

I've said it before, Active Measures continue to this day. Political warfare conducted by the Soviet or Russian government since the 1920s. It includes offensive programs such as espionage, propaganda, sabotage, and assassination.
Case and point! This planned sabotage by government every time just for political voting strategy is bullshit.

I always thought it was rather shortsighted of Boris Johnson to have two Asians working side-by-side with him they work for themselves not for anybody else
Well yeah but let's be clear, sending blacks away was part of mainstream American political discourse basically up until WW2. Lincoln had this opinion lol. It's not like it's lunacy to suggest it
The fact that theres tens of millions of Americans that hear this retard talk and not only think it's coherent but agree with it is beyond depressing and honestly just makes it hard not to just give up
17 years ago today 52 lives were lost to Islamic Terrorism perpetrated by people allowed into this country against the wishes of the indigenous people. Today we suffer the constant terrorism of random acts of violence against Whites by these colonisers. #WLM #LondonBombings
You let these dirty Asians these dirty nasty Mexicans come in from a third world mentality uneducated no high school diploma allow a manager sexual offender to rape a 14-year-old employee this was what get corporations burn to the ground
So if being wary of a religion whose adherents commit mindless acts of violence against non-adherents on a regularly basis is Islamophobia, I'd say Islamophobia is good.
I'd rather put a gun to my head and pull the trigger than deal with all these stupid fucking porch monkeys at this school.
I refuse to indulge these sick m'fker's mental illness. I will use the pronouns as I judge them. Trannys are mentally ill. It isn't transphobia that causes these sickos to kill themselves. It is mother nature culling the herd. I suppose I will get jail time now. GFY twitter.
